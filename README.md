The hole basic idea of Linceo comes after seen the UNIZAR stadistics about failure in 1st year students,
and seen that was not only happening in UNIZAR is happening all arround the glove.
So we take a step and try to fix it trying to safe Universities founds wich can se used for improve studies.

Also we are making a detailed profile of the students capacities, specialization and interest in order to
build a acurate database for companies searching specific individuals

__Update(10/28/2018): This proyect development is turning into academic institutional research and we will stop public development
untill we made the correct approach to handle this.__
